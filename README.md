# [Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889)
A repository of multiple projects and labs done in the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (aind).

### [Sudoku](/sudoku)

In this project, you will be writing code to implement two extensions of our sudoku solver. The first one will be to implement the technique called "naked twins". The second one will be to modify our existing code to solve a diagonal sudoku. To complete this project you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson, and build upon them.

Your goals are to implement the naked twins function, and write an AI agent that will solve the Diagonal Sudoku game.

### [PAC-MAN](https://github.com/ruihanzou/Teaching-Pac-Man-to-Search)

In this lab, you will teach Pac-Man to search his world to complete the following tasks:

find a single obstacle.
find multiple obstacles.
find the fastest way to eat all the food in the map.
